# BellyButton_Biodiversity
## Overview
### This project was created to help Roza complete her dashboard for belly button bacteria data. Roza wants her volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons. 
## Results
### A bar graph was created so the test subject could enter their ID number and look at the culture results. They would also be able to compare their results to other ID numbers while also noting ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and frequency. However, the actualy name of the participant is always kept anonymous.

### A bubble chart was completed to show bacteria cultures per sample. It was color coded, and was able to be looked up via the volunteers ID number and provided the volunteer with the type of Bacteria located. This is helpful because it gave a visual representation of the size of bacteria, relative to the other samples.

### Finally, a gauge chart was completed to show the number of belly button washes per week.

## Summary
### This was a good study and helped Roza show detailed data and give good feedback on her bacterial study.
